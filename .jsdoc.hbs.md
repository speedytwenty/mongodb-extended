# MongoDB Extended (mongodb-extended)

Extends the Node.js driver adding a useful API for modeling MongoDB objects and
keeping database structures in sync across environments.

**Use case:**

When using MongoDB _without_ a tool like [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), it
can be burdensome and problematic to maintain indexes, schemas, etc. across
environments.

This module provides a mechanism for configuring your MongoDB collections in
code and keeping things in sync across multiple environments.

### Collection Configuration Management

With mongodb-extended, your application can configure each collection as necessary
and mongodb-extended will keep the database in sync with your configuration.

This includes:

* Keeping indexes in sync between the database and configuration.
* Keeping collection options in sync between the database and configuration.
* Dropping legacy indexes as denoted in configuration.
* Pre-populating a collection with documents.

## Installation

*With NPM:*

`npm i mongodb-extended`

*With Yarn:*

`yarn add mongodb-extended`
